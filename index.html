        <h1>Blackjack</h1>
        <p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino card games worldwide, enjoyed by both beginners and experienced gamblers. The game involves players trying to beat the dealer by achieving a hand total of 21 points or as close to it as possible without going over. Players are dealt two cards, and they can choose to draw additional cards ("hit") or keep their current hand ("stand"). The excitement of the game lies in its combination of luck and strategy. </p>
        <p>The game is usually played with one or more decks of standard 52-card decks. The objective is simple: get a hand that totals 21 points or less, but higher than the dealer's hand. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can count as either 1 or 11 points, depending on what benefits the players hand the most.</p>
        <p>Blackjack is also called "21" due to the ultimate goal of the game, which is achieving a hand value of 21. Players and dealers are each dealt two cards, with the dealer showing one card face-up. The main strategy of the game involves deciding when to "hit" for more cards or "stand" to keep the hand. The tension in Blackjack comes from the fact that both the player's and dealer's decisions can influence the outcome in surprising ways.</p>
