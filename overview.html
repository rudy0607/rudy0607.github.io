        <h1>History of Blackjack</h1>
        <p>The origins of Blackjack date back to the 1700s in Europe, where it was originally known as Vingt-et-Un, French for "twenty-one." The game was played in French casinos during the reign of King Louis XV. Vingt-et-Un had similar rules to modern Blackjack, but it did not include the option to double down or split pairs, which are now part of the standard game.</p>
        <p>When Blackjack arrived in the United States in the 19th century, it was played in riverboat casinos. The game was popularized in Nevada during the early days of legal gambling. To attract more players, casinos offered a special payout of 10-to-1 if a player had the Ace of Spades and a black Jack, which is how the name "Blackjack" came to be.</p>
        <p>Blackjack became a staple in casinos worldwide, and its rules evolved over time to become what we know today. The game has been featured in countless movies, books, and documentaries, highlighting both its popularity and its potential for winning. In the 1960s, the advent of card counting, a strategy made famous by the "MIT Blackjack Team," brought the game even more into the spotlight.</p>
